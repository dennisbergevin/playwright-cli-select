## Installation

1. Install the following package:

```sh
npm install --save-dev playwright-cli-select
```

---

## Run mode

Run the following command:

```bash
npx playwright-cli-select run
```

If you want to skip straight to selecting specs, titles and/or tags:

```bash
npx playwright-cli-select run --specs
# skips straight to spec selection

npx playwright-cli-select run --titles
# skips to test title selection

npx playwright-cli-select run --tags
# skips to tag selection

npx playwright-cli-select run --titles --tags
# skips to test title selection, followed by tag selection
```

Any combination of `--specs`, `--titles` and/or `--tags` parameters is permitted.

You can also include more cli arguments similar to `npx playwright test`:

```bash
# Example
npx playwright-cli-select run --project=firefox
```

## Submit focused

When no other options are already selected, automatically select the currently focused option with <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

To enable this feature, pass the following flag:

```bash
npx playwright-cli-select run --submit-focused
```

---

## Using a custom playwright config file

If you want to use a custom Playwright config, pass it via the `-c` or `--config` flag:

```bash
npx playwright-cli-select run --config playwright.staging.config.js

# Or

npx playwright-cli-select run -c playwright.dev.config.js
```

---

## Setting up a `npm` script

For convenience, you may desire to house the `npx` command within an npm script in your project's `package.json`, including any desired cli arguments:

```json
  "scripts": {
    "pw:select": "npx playwright-cli-select run --project=firefox"
  }
```
